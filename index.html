			<p>Hi! I'm Ashley and I'm a 3rd year AGPM major at UCSC. I love to draw, mostly 2D art and so I am working diligently to be a part of the game industry as a game artist. I'm interested in both 2D illustrations and creating concept art.</p>
			<p>So far, I have enjoyed learning code. As of now, I am familiar with Python and JavaScript (comparatively less so), and currently, I am learning HTML and CSS :) I have a lot of fun problem solving in code and thinking differently to implement what I envision.</p>

			<h1>My Interests</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Digital Art
					<p>While I grew up with traditional art and have a strong background in it, over the years, I have grown to love digital art and it has become my main medium when drawing. I enjoy making anime-style artwork and fanart.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Arts & Crafts
					<p>I have a lot of fun making small crafts or artistic pieces as gifts for friends and family. I've done cross-stitching, worked with shrink plastic, making postcards, all sorts of small things. In my childhood, I also had a polymer clay phase but that didn't last too long.
				</li>
				<li>Playing Games
					<p>Lately, I've been playing a lot of Genshin Impact, but I also enjoy the Pokemon and Zelda series.
