	<h1><br>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>

	<div>
		<h4>Challenge</h4>
		<p>In this lab, we are getting familiar with conditionals.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h4>Problems</h4>
		<p>With the actual lab itself, I didn't have too many problems, but I wanted to do something extra and so I tried to output a color palette (since I'm sorting names into colors rather than houses). It was really difficult trying to make it work and format correctly. I used &ltdiv&gt and colored backgrounds to make it work but I'm not sure that's the most effective way. I saw that there is a &ltcanvas&gt tag but I couldn't get it to work with that. I could only get it to format correctly when the website is in full screen but when you minimize it, the size of the window messes up the formatting.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>I have a Lab 12 index.html file that is styled with CSS and I have a JavaScript file that takes user input and then uses conditionals to sort that name into different color groups.</p>
		<div class="tasks">
			<h4>Script Output</h4>
			<div id="output">
				<form>
					<label for="input">Input your name and find out what your color is:</label> <input type="text" id="input">
					<button type="button" id="button">Submit!</button>
					<p>***Make sure you click submit, not Enter!***</p>
				</form>
			</div>
			<a target="_blank" href="js/lab.js">Here is my JavaScript file.</a>
