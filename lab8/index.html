	<h1><br>Lab 8 - Anon Functions & Callbacks</h1>

	<div>
		<h4>Challenge</h4>
		<p>In this lab, we are getting familiar with JavaScript anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h4>Problems</h4>
		<p>I had some issues trying to figure out how to use an anonymous function with map() because I thought I was supposed to replace "function" with a function name and so I kept getting this error that said that I was missing a parenthesis when that wasn't really the case. (This can be seen in my screenshot for Task 1.) I also didn't quite understand the map() method too well until I played around with it and read up on it on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp">w3schools.com.</a> I also didn't conceptually understand what callbacks were despite probably already having used them in my previous coding experience. I think I finally get them though. They're functions that are being used as a parameter to another function and that main function then "applies" the callback function to its own parameters.
		<br><br>
		I also struggled with trying to do the bonus task of making the code results show. Luckily, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32939470/how-to-make-alert-box-and-innerhtml-show-in-javascript">this</a> helped with understanding how to put all the information that was given in the lecture and in the assignment together to make the results show. Also I couldn't get the code to work with using &ltdiv&gt so I had to change that and use &ltp&gt.</p>

		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>I have a Lab 8 index.html file that is styled with CSS and a JavaScript file that operates on numbers using anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
		<div class="tasks">
			<h4>Script Output</h4>
			<div id="output">
				Original: <pre><p id="original"></p></pre>
				<br>
				Squared: <p id="squared"></p>
				<br>
				Rooted: <p id="rooted"></p>
				<br>
				What numbers of the original are prime? <p id="original-p"></p>
				<br>
				Check the console or <button onClick="javascript:main()">click here.</button>
			</div>
			<br><br><br>
			<h4>Timer</h4>
			<h4 id="timer"></h4>
			<p>It's not perfect as I can't figure out how to add a "0" when it is a single digit, but I used setInterval() which uses a callback function I made called changeTimer().</p>
